#  Lightspeed Practical test

Source code of the iCabbi iOS passenger application

## Overview

- The minimum supported iOS version is iOS 16.0.
- The project is built using the MVVM architectural pattern (communication is handled natively by using delegates and property observers).
- The project is heavily relying on protocols as an abstraction mechanism which helps a lot for testing but also for dependency injection.
- All the layout is done by code. No storyboards are used
